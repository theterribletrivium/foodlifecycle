**Food Lifecycle**

The Food Lifecycle project is an attempt to facilitate the use of data when making choices around the cultivation and consumption of food.

**Grow**
- **Site selection** - Where to place garden beds, plots, or individual plants based on sunlight, existing soil, drainage, etc.
- **Plant Selection** - climate, available tasks, productions goals, grouping symbiotic plants or plants that require similar conditions, preventing planting of incompatible plants
- **Scheduled Tasks** - prune, weed, harvest, etc.
- **Yield Calculator** - Yield expectations based on square footage/number of plants
- **Preservation** - Canning/preserving technique suggestions
- **Accessibility** - Filters out suggestions that might be difficult for some individuals to physically accomplish due to disabilities.


**Eat**
- **Macgyver Mode** - What can I make with what I have in the refrigerator and utensils and cooking tools that i have?
- **Shopping Planner** - What should I buy to maximize for nutrients, for calories, etc.
-  **Exclusion Filtering** - food exclusions from allergy, dietary restrictions or dislike
- **Grow Schedule Sync** - What can I expect to use when from "Grow" based on the harvest schedule?
- **Well-Structured Recipes** - include meta like utensils required, time for each step, etc. to make it easier to time things to come out at the same time, and to provide relevant results
